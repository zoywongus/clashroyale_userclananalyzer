<h1>Clash Royale Analyzer-WebApp</h1>
<h3>This Web Application is created through NodeJS as server, which also runs Python Scripts</h3>
<p>
  Given the user supplies the proper information, this app can analyze user profiles, their battles, their clan. </br>
  Also can analyze user-user to compare two players, or two clans also. All data scraped/analyzed from the official Clash Royale API. </br>
  SciKit-Learn was utilized in Python to give user proper machine-learning mathematical predictions to some of the future battles and a future prediction of leaderboard trophy count.</br>
  Planned future updates will implement clan wars and more API data, and will go further into data analysis techniques.
